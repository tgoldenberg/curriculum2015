#[Do Now] Project 3  - Re-Branding

The do now activity for this session is to visit two website homepages - 
[codeschool.com](https://www.codeschool.com/) and [berkshirehathaway.com](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/)

Now, which of the two is better? Why? What are some design techniques that the least better can use to improve its user experience? 

Using [Google](https://www.google.com) to help you, answer the following questions to prepare for today's challenge: 
* What is a wireframe? (Yes/No)
* What is user experience? 
* What role does design play in the development of a website?
